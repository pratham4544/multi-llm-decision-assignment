I have $1000 to invest for 5 years. Compare these options:
    1. Savings account (2% APR)
    2. Index fund (average 7% return)
    3. High-risk stocks (15% potential, but volatile)
    
    Calculate returns and recommend based on risk tolerance."

Design a database schema for a multi-tenant SaaS application with these requirements:
    - Support 1000+ tenants
    - Each tenant has users, projects, tasks, and comments
    - Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Member)
    - Must support audit logging
    - Query performance is critical
    - Data isolation between tenants is mandatory
    
    Provide:
    1. Complete schema design (tables, relationships)
    2. Indexing strategy
    3. Scalability considerations
    4. Security approach
    5. Migration strategy from single-tenant

    - Scales to 1B+ events/day
    - Budget: $10K/month
    
    Specify:
    - Technology stack
    - Architecture diagram (describe in text)

    - Failure handling
    - Monitoring strategy""",
    
    # Deep technical reasoning
    """A distributed system is experiencing these issues:
    - Latency spikes every 30 minutes
    - CPU usage patterns show sawtooth curve
    - Memory usage gradually increases then drops
    - Network traffic bursts coincide with latency
    
    Logs show:
    - GC pauses during latency spikes
    - Database connection pool exhaustion
    - Cache invalidation storms
    
    Provide:
    1. Root cause analysis
    2. Short-term fixes (next 24 hours)
    3. Long-term solutions (next 3 months)
    4. Monitoring improvements
    5. Architecture changes needed
